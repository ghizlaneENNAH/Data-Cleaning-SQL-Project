#  Layoffs Data Cleaning Project  

##  About  
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the `layoffs.csv` dataset, which contains layoff data from various companies. The cleaning steps include removing duplicates, standardizing data, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in the dataset.

##  Data Cleaning Steps  

###  1. Remove Duplicates  
Used `ROW_NUMBER()` to identify and remove duplicate records.  

###  2. Standardize Data  
- Trimmed leading and trailing spaces.  
- Fixed inconsistent values (e.g., `Crypto` vs `Cryptocurrency`).  
- Corrected country name formatting (`United States.` → `United States`).  

###  3. Convert Data Types  
- Converted `date` from `TEXT` to `DATE` format using `STR_TO_DATE()`.  

###  4. Handle NULL and Blank Values  
- Replaced empty `industry` values by inferring from other company records.  
- Deleted records where `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` were both `NULL`.  

###  5. Final Cleanup  
- Removed the extra `row_num` column used for duplicate removal.

##  Key Insights  
After cleaning, the dataset is structured and reliable for further data analysis, helping to identify trends and patterns in corporate layoffs.
